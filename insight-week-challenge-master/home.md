We have created a series of technology challenges for you to complete - with
difficulties from beginner-friendly to advanced. 

We know not everyone signed up for the Digital stream for the Insight Week, but
please get involved and see what you can do!

The challenges that we have created are hosted on a platform where you will
earn points for the challenges that you complete. At the end of the week, the
participant who earns the most points will be crowned as the winner. The
platform can be found by clicking the button below this text.
